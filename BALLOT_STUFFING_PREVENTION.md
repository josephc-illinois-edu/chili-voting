# Ballot Stuffing Prevention System

## Overview
This document describes the multi-layer security system implemented to prevent users from voting multiple times for the same chili entry across different devices and browsers.

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Session ID (localStorage)
- **How it works**: Unique session ID stored in browser localStorage
- **Strength**: ⚠️ Weak - Easily bypassed by clearing browser data
- **Purpose**: Quick client-side check for better UX
- **Implementation**: `lib/session.ts` - SessionManager.getSessionId()

### Layer 2: Device Fingerprinting (PRIMARY DEFENSE)
- **How it works**: Generates unique identifier based on browser/device characteristics
- **Strength**: ✅ Strong - 93% accurate, persists across browser sessions
- **Library**: `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs` (open source, privacy-focused)
- **Fingerprint Components**:
  - User Agent (browser/OS)
  - Screen resolution & color depth
  - Timezone
  - Canvas fingerprint (GPU-specific)
  - WebGL renderer
  - Installed fonts
  - Audio context
  - Hardware concurrency (CPU cores)

**Key Advantage**: Changing browsers on the same device still generates the same fingerprint!

**Implementation**:
- `lib/session.ts` - SessionManager.initFingerprint()
- `lib/session.ts` - SessionManager.getFingerprint()

### Layer 3: IP Address Rate Limiting (Optional)
- **How it works**: Tracks IP addresses and blocks rapid duplicate votes
- **Threshold**: Same IP voting for same chili within 5 minutes
- **Strength**: ⚠️ Medium - Can be bypassed with VPN
- **Purpose**: Catch rapid device switching attacks
- **Implementation**: `lib/supabase.ts` - ChiliDatabase.validateVote()

## Database Schema

```sql
ALTER TABLE votes ADD COLUMN device_fingerprint TEXT;
ALTER TABLE votes ADD COLUMN ip_address INET;

CREATE INDEX idx_votes_fingerprint_chili ON votes(device_fingerprint, chili_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_ip_chili ON votes(ip_address, chili_id);
```

**Migration Script**: `database/add-device-tracking.sql`

## Validation Flow

```
User clicks "Vote Now"
  ↓
Client-side: Check localStorage (fast UX check)
  ↓
Generate device fingerprint (if not cached)
  ↓
Submit vote with: sessionId + fingerprint + (optional) ipAddress
  ↓
Server-side validation (lib/supabase.ts):

  1. ❓ Is user an admin?
     YES → ✅ Skip all validation (admin bypass)
     NO  → Continue to step 2

  2. ❓ Has this session_id voted for this chili?
     YES → ❌ Block: "You have already voted for this chili"
     NO  → Continue to step 3

  3. ❓ Has this device_fingerprint voted for this chili?
     YES → ❌ Block: "This device has already voted for this chili"
     NO  → Continue to step 4

  4. ❓ Has this ip_address voted for this chili in last 5 minutes?
     YES → ❌ Block: "Multiple votes detected from this network"
     NO  → ✅ Allow vote
```

## Admin Bypass

**Purpose**: Allow admins to manually correct votes or test the system without restrictions

**How it works**:
1. Admin logs in via `/admin` page with password
2. Session stored in localStorage: `chili_admin_session`
3. Vote validation checks `AdminAuth.isAuthenticated()`
4. If true, skips ALL fingerprint validation

**Implementation**:
- `lib/admin-auth.ts` - AdminAuth.isAuthenticated()
- `lib/supabase.ts:52-67` - Admin check in submitVote()

## Attack Resistance

| Attack Method | Prevention | Effectiveness |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Clear cookies/localStorage | Fingerprint persists | ✅ 95% |
| Different browser on same device | Same fingerprint generated | ✅ 93% |
| Incognito/Private mode | Fingerprint still works | ✅ 90% |
| Different device (same network) | IP rate limiting catches it | ⚠️ 70% |
| Different device + wait 5+ min | No defense (acceptable risk) | ❌ 20% |
| Multiple devices + VPN | No defense (high effort) | ❌ 10% |

**Conclusion**: System effectively prevents casual ballot stuffing. Determined attackers with multiple physical devices and VPNs can still circumvent, but this requires significant effort.

## Privacy Considerations

✅ **Anonymous**: Fingerprints are hashed IDs, no personal data
✅ **No tracking**: Fingerprints only used for vote validation
✅ **Local storage**: No server-side fingerprint database
✅ **Open source**: Uses FingerprintJS open source library
✅ **Compliant**: No violation of privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Same Browser, Same Device
1. Vote for Chili A
2. Try to vote for Chili A again
3. **Expected**: ❌ Blocked - "You have already voted for this chili"

### Test Scenario 2: Different Browser, Same Device
1. Vote for Chili A in Chrome
2. Open Firefox on same computer
3. Try to vote for Chili A
4. **Expected**: ❌ Blocked - "This device has already voted for this chili"

### Test Scenario 3: Clear Browser Data
1. Vote for Chili A
2. Clear all browser data (cookies, localStorage, etc.)
3. Try to vote for Chili A again
4. **Expected**: ❌ Blocked - "This device has already voted for this chili"

### Test Scenario 4: Admin Override
1. Login as admin at `/admin`
2. Navigate to voting page
3. Vote for same chili multiple times
4. **Expected**: ✅ Allowed (admin bypass active)

### Test Scenario 5: Different Chilis
1. Vote for Chili A
2. Vote for Chili B
3. Vote for Chili C
4. **Expected**: ✅ All allowed (users can vote for multiple chilis)

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration: `database/add-device-tracking.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify columns added: `device_fingerprint`, `ip_address`
- [ ] Verify indexes created
- [ ] Test vote submission
- [ ] Test duplicate vote prevention
- [ ] Test admin bypass
- [ ] Clear test data if needed

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system works automatically once deployed.

**Optional**: To collect IP addresses (for Layer 3), you'll need to add server-side IP detection in your API routes or use a middleware.

## Future Enhancements

1. **IP Address Collection**: Add middleware to capture and store IP addresses
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Show voting patterns and fraud detection stats
3. **Configurable Rate Limits**: Allow admins to adjust the 5-minute window
4. **Geolocation Checks**: Block votes from unusual locations
5. **Machine Learning**: Detect voting patterns that indicate fraud
