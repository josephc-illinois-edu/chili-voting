## 🚀 Quick Start - Getting Everything Running

### Step 1: Database Migration

Run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy contents from: database/add-photo-upload-fields.sql
ALTER TABLE chili_entries
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS entry_code TEXT UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chili_entries_entry_code ON chili_entries(entry_code);
```

### Step 2: Supabase Storage Setup

Follow the detailed guide in: `database/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md`

**Quick version:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create new bucket: `chili-photos` (public)
3. Set up RLS policies (allow public read, authenticated upload)

### Step 3: Generate Entry Codes

For existing entries without codes:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-entry-codes.ts
```

This will:
- Find all entries without codes
- Generate unique codes (e.g., `CHILI-7X2M`)
- Update database

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Already configured in `.env.local`:
```env
# Photo Upload Deadline
EVENT_DATE=2025-11-19T12:00:00-06:00
```

Make sure this is also set in Vercel:
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `EVENT_DATE` with the same value

### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add photo upload feature with entry codes and deadline enforcement"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

## ❓ FAQs

### How do entrants get their codes?

**Option 1 (Current):**
- You manually share codes from admin panel
- Copy code and send via email/text

**Option 2 (Future):**
- Implement email integration (Phase 3)
- Auto-send codes after Google Form submission

### Can I change the deadline?

Yes! Update `EVENT_DATE` in:
1. `.env.local` (local testing)
2. Vercel environment variables (production)
3. Redeploy

Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-TZ`

Example: `2025-11-19T12:00:00-06:00` (Noon CST on Nov 19, 2025)

### What if someone loses their code?

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Find their entry
3. Copy their code
4. Share with them again

### Can I disable photo uploads temporarily?

Yes! Set `EVENT_DATE` to a past date:
```env
EVENT_DATE=2020-01-01T00:00:00-06:00
```

This will lock all uploads immediately.

### What image formats are supported?

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- HEIC (.heic) - iPhone photos
- WebP (.webp)
- Max size: 5MB

### Do photos affect voting?

No! Photos are NOT displayed during voting (`/vote` page) - they only appear on the results page (`/results`) after voting is complete. This prevents bias.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Entry not found with this code"

**Cause:** Entry doesn't have a code yet.

**Fix:** Run the code generation script:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-entry-codes.ts
```

### "Failed to upload photo"

**Possible causes:**
1. Storage bucket not created → Check Supabase Storage
2. RLS policies not set → Run storage setup SQL
3. File too large → Max 5MB
4. Invalid file type → Only images allowed

### "Upload deadline has passed"

**Cause:** Current time is after `EVENT_DATE`.

**Fix:**
- For testing: Set `EVENT_DATE` to a future date
- For production: Deadline is intentional, uploads locked

### Photos not showing on results page

**Cause:** Entry has `entry_code` but no `photo_url`.

**Fix:** This is normal - entrant hasn't uploaded photo yet. They need to:
1. Visit `/upload/[their-code]`
2. Upload a photo

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Deadline Time

Edit `EVENT_DATE` in environment variables. Examples:

```env
# Different times (adjust timezone as needed)
EVENT_DATE=2025-11-19T09:00:00-06:00   # 9 AM
EVENT_DATE=2025-11-19T15:00:00-06:00   # 3 PM
EVENT_DATE=2025-11-19T23:59:59-06:00   # End of day
```

### Change Code Format

Edit `lib/entry-codes.ts`:

```typescript
// Current: CHILI-XXXX
return `CHILI-${randomPart}`;

// Alternative formats:
return `SPICY-${randomPart}`;     // SPICY-7X2M
return `CC25-${randomPart}`;      // CC25-7X2M
return `${randomPart}`;           // Just 7X2M
```

### Change Max File Size

Edit `app/api/upload-photo/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Current: 5MB
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024;

// Alternatives:
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024;  // 10MB
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024;   // 2MB
```
