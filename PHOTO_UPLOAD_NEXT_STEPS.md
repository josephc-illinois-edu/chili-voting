# üì∏ Photo Upload Feature - Next Steps

## ‚ö° Immediate Actions (Required)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Migration (5 minutes)

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Add new fields
ALTER TABLE chili_entries
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS entry_code TEXT UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Create index for fast lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chili_entries_entry_code ON chili_entries(entry_code);
```

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'chili_entries'
AND column_name IN ('entry_code', 'photo_url', 'photo_uploaded_at');
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Supabase Storage Bucket (5 minutes)

1. **Go to:** Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. **Click:** "New bucket"
3. **Configure:**
   - Name: `chili-photos`
   - Public bucket: ‚úÖ YES
   - Click "Create bucket"

4. **Set policies** (SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Allow public read
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for chili photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'chili-photos');

-- Allow uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to chili-photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'chili-photos' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow updates
CREATE POLICY "Allow photo updates in chili-photos"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'chili-photos')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'chili-photos');

-- Allow deletions
CREATE POLICY "Allow photo deletions in chili-photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'chili-photos');
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Entry Codes (2 minutes)

If you already have entries in the database:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-entry-codes.ts
```

This will assign codes like `CHILI-7X2M` to all existing entries.

**Verify in admin panel:**
- Go to `/admin`
- You should see codes next to each entry

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variable in Vercel (2 minutes)

The `EVENT_DATE` is already in `.env.local`, but you need to add it to Vercel:

1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
2. **Add New:**
   - Name: `EVENT_DATE`
   - Value: `2025-11-19T12:00:00-06:00`
   - Environment: **Production**, **Preview**, **Development** (all 3)
3. **Click:** "Save"

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy (5 minutes)

```bash
# Check everything builds
npm run build

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add photo upload feature with entry codes and deadline enforcement"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy. Watch the deployment logs.
